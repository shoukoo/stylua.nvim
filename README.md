# stylua.nvim

This repository is heavily inspired by [ckipp01's repo](github.com/ckipp01/stylua-nvim.git )

stylua.nvim is a minimal wrapper around the Lua code formatter,
[StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua). It does pretty much what
you'd expect it to do, format your Lua file using Stylua.

### Install
Make sure you have StyLua installed and then install this plugin:

```lua
use({"shoukoo/stylua.nvim"})
```

### Docs

Everything you need should be in the [help
docs](https://github.com/shoukoo/stylua.nvim/blob/master/doc/stylua.txt).
